# Assumptions

1. The rate of change for pace of corrupting factors is exceeding rate of change for mechanisms that correct for corrupting factors
  * Increasing complexity of our global civilization and its problems is resulting in increased specialization
  * This makes it harder for individuals to understand the entire system 

2. The implication of 1) is that individual decisions for complex problems are made largely on the basis of a combination of social pressures and/or trust in other people’s opinions (often as an amalgam of others’ analyses as a proxy for personal expertise)

3. The trust mechanisms currently in place for mass (national/global) efforts, such as the internet, news, television, and other media), are very much subject to rule 1. 

4. Because of 1B), even experts are often wrong; they conflate expertise in their specialty with cross-discipline expertise or “global-scope” expertise. I.e. there isn’t really a way to educate yourself into immunity from the problem. Sometimes bad actors intentionally mislead followers, because incentives are often based on appearing correct rather than earnestly prioritizing truth.

5.Impact magnification due to population growth is likely to make some global concerns fatal (or at least exceedingly reduce potential  quality of life) to the human species (e.g. environment) because corrupting factors are preventing rational and proactive action

6.People want to make good decisions, but for the reasons listed above and many more, we often substitute “easy” for “rigorous”

7. Trust is one social model that people use to make “easy” be rigorous enough to get by. Helping people understand who they can trust within the context of a given problem space would improve this model.

# Problem Statement

Create a distributed trust network that punishes selfish or partisan actors and rewards global/selfless actors who rationally push us to better long-term outcomes. The system must:

1. Be easy for people to use
2. Enable informed and rational decisions or opinions
3. Provide strong incentive for early adopters
4. Be self-correcting over time
5. Be very difficult to corrupt
6. Encourage / incentivize fact checking and more generally critical thinking

The system should ideally:

1. Weight of trust for atomic data points decreases the older they are
2. Provide an open framework/protocol that makes it easy to integrate or adopt this system with proprietary platforms
3. Put pressure on proprietary platforms to adopt
